# It Always Picks You!

## Overview
~~A rip-off of~~ _An homage to_ the seemingly-abandoned start-player-choosing app Chwazi, packaged as a Progressive Web App. Available for use at [https://itpicksyou.wily.cc/](https://itpicksyou.wily.cc).

The name? There are inevitably accusations of cheating by some sore loser of the start-player-choosing lottery. This app is just as rigged as all the rest!

## Usage
For use on touch-enabled devices. Everybody put a finger on the screen, and wait a couple of seconds. Your fate will be determined.

## Feature Requests
Currently just picks one person. Do you want it to be able to select more than one person, or to divide people into two or more groups? Let me know!
